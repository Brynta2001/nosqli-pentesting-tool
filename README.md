# NoSQLi Pentesting Tool

## Description

This educational tool is designed to help users understand and exploit NoSQL Injection (NoSQLi) vulnerabilities. It is developed using Node.js and JavaScript.

## Developers Team

This project is developed by a team of dedicated developers:
- Mateo Díaz
- Emilio Montalvo
- Mateo Pérez
- Bryan Tapia

## Libraries Used

This project uses the following libraries:
- axios: Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.
- chalk: Terminal string styling done right.
- prompt-sync: A synchronous prompt for node.js.

## Installation

Before you start, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Brynta2001/nosqli-pentesting-tool.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd nosqli-pentesting-tool`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

To use the tool, follow these steps:

1. Run the application: `node index.js`
2. When prompted, enter the URL of the vulnerable site.

## Files

- `payload.js`: Contains the payloads or scripts to exploit the vulnerability.
- `style.js`: Contains functions to display the response in different colors based on the result.
- `index.js`: The main file that runs the attack. It prompts the user for the URL of the vulnerable site, creates an instance of axios with specific defaults and interceptors, and then attempts the attack by sending requests with payloads in JSON format. The response is displayed in different colors based on the result of the attack.
